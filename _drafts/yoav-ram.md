#Who are you and what do you do?

I'm a graduate student at the [Hadany Evolutionary Theory Lab](https://sites.google.com/site/hadanylab) in Tel-Aviv University. The main focus of my research is the evolution of mutation rates - more specificaly I study how organisms evolve to induced higher rates of mutation when facing stress or maladaptation and how these stress-induced mutation rates affect other biological and evolutionary processes. As a theoretical evolutionary biologist, I use mathematical and computational tools.

#What hardware do you use?

My main working station is the amazingly thin and light *Samsung Series 9* laptop. It's got an i7 quad-core, 8 GB RAM, 256 GB SSD, 13.1'' screen and a very good keyboard and touchpad. And the best thing about it is that it is only weighs 1.3 KG and is .50'' wide, which is good because I carry it around on my back all the time. On the other hand, it runs Windows 7 64-bit, which I would have gladly replaced with Ubuntu. At the lab I've got a multi-core (12, I think) multi-giga RAM desktop/server running Ubuntu 12.01 which I use as a server for computing and command and control. And I got a *Samsung Galaxy S* smartphone with a SlimBean rom. I also recently bought a *Raspberry Pi* which I intend to turn into a *less-than-50$-media-streamer* in the living room.

#What software do you use?

I write code mainly with *Python*, for simulations, scripting, web servers and generally everything that I don't do with a specialist language. I write the code with *Sublime Text 2* and/or *IPython notebook*, which I use both as a persistent interactive shell and to create documents and presentations (using the new *reveal converter*). I say persistent because I version control my notebooks.

I use *R* for data analysis, statistics and plotting (with *ggplot2*). I write R code on *RStudio*- I got the desktop version on my laptop but mostly use the server version on the lab server.

For mathematical stuff like symbolic computation, I use *Wolfram Mathematica* - it's very impressive but I don't like that its syntax is so different from the other languages I use and that it is propriety and costs so much. The latter can also be said on *Mathworks Matlab*, which I try not to use, but I do sometime because I colloborate on a project that uses a library that exists only in Matlab.
